# Objective Time

Objective Time is a minimal web app that frames time within the percentage of the day that has passed.

## Why Objective Time?

My own heuristics about time are often inaccurate. I tend to underestimate the amount of
time I have left in the day and overestimate the amount of time I have already spent.
Objective Time shows you how much of the day you have left, to try and help you make the
most of it.
